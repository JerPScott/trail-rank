# Trail Rank Ruby on Rails application

This application provides a platform for users
to share information and ratings on trails. The
intent is to make trails of all kinds more
accessible by providing information and sharing
experiences.

## Getting started

To get started with this app, clone the repo
and then install the required gems:

'''
$ bundle install --without production
'''

Next, migrate the database:

'''
$ rails db:migrate
'''

Finally, run the test suite to verify that
everything is working correctly:

'''
$ rails test
'''

If the test suite passes, you will be ready
to run the app in a local server:

'''
$ rails server
'''
